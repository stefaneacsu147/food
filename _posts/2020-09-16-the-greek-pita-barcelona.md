# The Greek Pita

Third review from the list will be for <b>The Greek Pita<b/> (Carrer de Muntaner, 472, Barcelona).

For this place I just found it recently since I was craving some good Gyros or something like a Souvlaki but of course is not the case. This does not compare to the one you find in Greece but they are decent for the price.

<!-- more -->

As the name suggests they are a Greek cuisine oriented restaurant so you can find some some Pita de Pollo, Keftedes, Chorizo Artesanal, Falafel and Calamar or the same but on a plate. I am not a Greek cuisine conoisseur but I suppose most of them are more suitable to the Spanish taste since I do not think they have Gyros with calamar or with Chorizo but I never tried them, maybe they are actually good, maybe some day I will order them and post a review.
	
## Food

I think I ordered like more than 3 times from this place and I got almost all the time the same thing which is: <b>Menu Pita Individual</b> which costs 9,90 â‚¬.

This includes a pita with the above mentioned types (Chicken, Chorizo, etc.) and a portion of fries with feta cheese.

The food comes in the package like seen in the above photo, the portion I think is enough for a person and to satisfy your hunger for the needed time(s). 

I would say that the pita is medium to small size and the ingredients are not always so fresh or tasty. I usually take mine with tzatziki sauce but I tried once with garlic sauce and it was decent but nothing impressive.
	
One thing I like is the fries with feta cheese, maybe just because I miss my home country cheese and feta reminds me of it or I am a fatty that enjoys fries with cheese and grease but I can say the highlight of this place are the <b>fries with feta cheese</b>. 
	
In my opinion they are the tastiest even though the fries are probably just freezed and thrown together with the feta.

## Final
	
My opinion about the <b>The Greek Pita</b> is that is nothing *impressive* that would stand out or something that would make me be like: "oh shit, I really want to order from this place again" or "lets go eat in this place th food is amazing".
	
As I said above the best thing and what I enjoy the most is the fries with the feta cheese, they are really tasty in my opinion.
	
I would not recommend this place if you actually want to taste authenthic Greek food since this is not what it is and I do not even think this is what they are going for. Is just like a Kebab shop but the Greek version where they just made their thing and put their twist in it, you know? Like everybody else.
	
The menu is not bad, I cannot give some links since I cannot find them on <b>Google</b> or in other food apps like <b>Glovo</b> so I assume they are still working on the online part.
	
Usually the menu are priced reasonable and nothing exagerated.
	
In the end this is a good place if you want to try something else and you do not really have expectations for the food to be great or care about it in general. Do not go in mind that this would taste like something that you can find in Greece or tried in Greece, is really different but beside that is not *bad* to try it.
