# The Healthy Poke

Second review from the list will be for <b>[The Healthy Poke](https://www.healthypoke.com/)<b/> (Carrer de Morales, 27, 08029 Barcelona, España).

I discovered this place when I was looking for something more *"healthy"* since I ate a lot of fatty foods and my liver was complaining and wanted something different to feel better and not that greasy so c'est ca, that is how I discovered this place.

<!-- more -->

As the name suggests they have different Poke bowls that I would say are pretty good taste wise and at an affordable price.
	
## Food

I have ordered more than 3 times from them and I can say the quality is always the same. I always went for the <b>Healthy Chicken</b> that contains rice sushi, chicken, mango, avocado, cherry tomatoes, onion and spicy mayo.

I kind of like the mix of these going together since it creates a nice taste and the spicy mayo really gives it a special flavour when you are eating.

The food comes in the package like seen in the above photo, the portion I think is enough for a person and to satisfy your hunger for the needed time(s). 

This one I ordered is the small portion but for 2 more euros you can order the big one that I think would be a bit better if you are looking for a nice lunch or dinner that would satisfy your hunger for a longer period of time.

As you can see the Poke Bowl is decent and the ingredients are fresh and tasty and for the price I do not think is a bad deal (10,95 €). Also, if you would like you have the chance to create your own poke bowl since again if you are not a *basic bitch* as me you could try and make your perfect poke bowl instead of letting other people tell you what goes in your food.
	

## Final
	
If you are looking for a nice healthy meal that has good ingredients and tastes good I would recommend you to check out [The Healthy Poke](https://www.healthypoke.com/). It is a bit weird that in their website they are not mentioning any Barcelona locations (Corona related maybe) but as you can see they have 4 locations in Madrid and one in Barcelona.

By checking their [menu](https://www.healthypoke.com/carta/) you can see they have other things that you could order like the Burritos or if you are just looking for a quick bite they have Tartar, Hummus and Salads that would be perfect for a breakfast.
	
I can see that their prices differ quite a bit and they have always offers coming and going so I would check if you are going to order from delivery apps like Glovo, Deliveroo if they have some offers happening on these apps or on their website since you could get a better price for the dish you would like.
	
In the end, if you are looking for a healthy meal with a good price and quality ingredients you cannot go wrong with <b>The Healthy Poke</b>.
