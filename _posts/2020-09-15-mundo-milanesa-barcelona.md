# Mundo Milanesa

First review from the list will be for [Mundo Milanesa](https://www.milanesabarcelona.com/) (Carrer de Tordera, 30).

I discovered this restaurant some weeks ago when I was searching in the Glovo application for something new to eat since I was tired of all the burgers, asiatic food or the tapas.

<!-- more -->

If I recall correctly I stumbled upon them since they had a nice offer where you could get 2 menu's (Milanesa + fries) for the price of 1. I am not sure if they still have the offer but it is maybe worth to check since I can see they always run some kind of offers.

In general they have only Milanesa's and fries (you can choose from normal fries, sweet potatoes ones or oven baked ones) and for sweets or deserts they have ice cream (Ben & Jerry) different flavours and some Nutella Cookies.

## Food

I have ordered more than 8 times from them and I can say the quality is always the same. Not too bad not too god but is consistent which I think is important with the food in general so you cannot say you have sometimes a bad experience eating something good and next time you will be like: "I hope I do not get food poisoning".

The food comes in the package like seen in the above photo, the portion I think is enough for a person and to satisfy your hunger for the needed time(s).

I would attach down below some photos of my last order and my favorite one that I ordered the most which is Milanesa Parmesana which for me has the best taste and perfect combination.

As you can see the Milanesa is pretty big and the portion in general is pretty generous for the price (8,90 €).

## Final
Since the pandemic started and I am becoming more and more lazy to cook all of my meals at home I am ordering more and more food and I always was "picky" with food and my stomach is a bit sensitive so I cannot say I enjoy food as much as other people but probably <b>Mundo Milanesa<b> is one of the good restaurants that you can find on [Glovo](https://glovoapp.com/en/bcn/store/mundo-milanesa-bcn/).
	
I think for the prices they are giving the food and portions (less than 10 €) for most of the main dishes is one of the best in my personal opinion for a nice meal.
	
Also, as a side note you can also make your own Milanesa which maybe is more important for some other people but I am pretty dull so I just take the already made ones because I do not trust my decisions, which I think is a nice touch from them to create your own Milanesa with the ingredient(s) you like.
	
In the end, I highly recommend <b>Mundo Milanesa</b> since it has some good pros (quality and price) and for cons I cannot think of anything else beside maybe having more variety or food's to pick from but I do not really think this is such a big con since the name is Milanesa so they are doing what they know the best.
