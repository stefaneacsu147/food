# Bacoa Burger

Fifth review from the list will be for <b>[Bacoa Burger](https://www.bacoaburger.com/en/)<b/> (Carrer Judici, 15).

Bacoa, I found it by mistake when I was coming one day back from the beach and I was craving with some of my friends some burgers. I tried it before in their restaurant before the COVID lockdown started in Barcelona and I remember that this was one of the good burgers I had in Barcelona.

<b>Bacoa Burger </b> started as a small "hamburgueseria" with only 15 seats behind the Caterina Market in Barceloan in 2010, founded by a young Australian chef and his Spanish wife. 

The above part was taken from their website, and it expresses how the business started and expanded. I think I heard from someone that they actually sold the restaurants for 4 million euro right before the lockdown has started so I am looking forward to see if the quality will drop or increase/maintain.
	
## Food

In general I think I have tried most of their burgers and I can say that I liked most of them.
	
If it would be to choose a favorite one I really like the Suiza one with Emmenthal Swiss Cheese and the La Bacoa one is pretty good.

The food comes in the package like seen in the above photo, the portion I think is enough for a person and to satisfy your hunger for the needed time(s). 

The fries are really tasty and you can choose to get wedgies style or patatas bravas instead of simple french fries.
	
I tried the patatas bravas they are not the best but not bad either.

I usually order the burgers as medium to well-done since I do not realy like rare burgers (thank you, France).
	
The taste is excellent and the pan is really moist and good. The ingredients were always fresh and I cannot really complain about anything since all the burgers I have tried seem well thought and prepared so everything work in unison.

## Final
	
<b>Bacoa</b> is one if not the best burger place in Barcelona in my opinion.
	
This is a bit of a matter of taste since I do not really like the traditional hamburgeseria places I found so far in Spain because in my opinion the meat tastes a bit different to me than the one I am used too or the meat quality is not as good as I am used to.
	
But with Bacoa, I cannot complain about the meat or the ingredients since always when I went or ordered the food was good and without issues.
	
This really makes me think to start making a list for the best burger places in Barcelona since I am not sure if there are other hidden gems that are better or as good as Bacoa.
	
In the end, I totally recommend Bacoa if you want to eat a good burger. Is a burger after all, everyone knows what they are getting but sometimes the quality is not as good as you are expecting.
	
This is not the case for <b>Bacoa</b>.
	
If you have a chance try <b>Bacoa</b> is pretty close to Barcelonetta beach and it has a nice terrace outside where you can enjoy your food and drinks.
