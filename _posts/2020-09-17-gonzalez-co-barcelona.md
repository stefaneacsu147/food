# Gonzalez & Co

Fourth review from the list will be for <b>[Gonzalez & Co](https://www.gonzalezandco.com/en/)<b/> (Carrer de Còrsega, 391).

For Gonzalez & Co, I found it because I was craving some burritos or fajitas that are Mexican (do not say this is mexican to mexicans). They have a range of good products at an affordable price and the ingredients are good quality in general.

<b>Gonzalez & Co </b> it is a Mexican Grill restaurant that has "mexican food" presented at an affordable price for Barcelona and with good quality ingredients.

Most of their food from the menu is mexican but you can find some mixes too which are not really related to Mexico.
	
I actually asked my roommmate about this place since she is Mexican if she thinks is good and now I am a disgrace to Mexico and her family just because I ordered from this place so be aware of asking Mexicans about "TexMex" as they call them since they get offended easily.
	
## Food

I usually ordered their normal Burrito which costs (7,20 €) and contains rice, frijoles, a bit of cheese and pico de gallo (no idea how to translate this properly in English).
	
I would say the size of it is a bit too small for my tastes but it is pretty fullfiling.
	
They also have their own "Gonzalez" Burrito which is a bit bigger but with similar ingredients with the one you can see in the photo which is a bit more expensive (8,90 €), but the size is bigger.

The food comes in the package like seen in the above photo, the portion I think is enough for a person and to satisfy your hunger for the needed time(s). 

I do not really know anything about Mexican food beside that I love Rajas and Quesadillas but most of their principal menu in terms of taste and portions are good and the price is pretty good as well.
	
I also ordered the Fajitas sometimes but in my opinion the better one is the normal Burrito.

Also, the Quesadillas are very tasty but for me it was not enough to get full but still pretty taste and the flavours are really good.

## Final
	
My opinion about <b>Gonzalez & Co</b> is that is a good "TexMex" restaurant. Do not expect real Mexican food outside of Mexico.
	
This is a good replacement if you fell in love with the mexican food but I think they are actually better alternatives in Barcelona that would be closer to Mexican food but I do not know them so far but I heard about some places that I would probably check them in the future.
	
If you want a nice quick meal, a Burrito can never go wrong and the same with Quesadillas which are so fucking tasty in my opinion, like you cannot go wrong with Quesadillas.
	
I would recommend <b>Gonzalez & Co</b> if you want to try some decent food with a good price bargain.

You should check their menu in their website and usually in the deliveries applications they have offers for different products so you can maybe get a nice offer when you check it.
	
In the end, <b>Gonzalez & Co</b> is not a true Mexican food, only if you want to trigger Mexicans or want to be stabbed by your Mexican roommate you can say this and see how hell unleashes.

The food is good in general, I cannot complain especially a Burrito after a work out really gives you that boost and protein and that *toilet rush* but is a good choice.
